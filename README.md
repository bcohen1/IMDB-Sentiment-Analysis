# Predicting IMDB Sentiment
Use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) deep learning model to predict sentiment (positive or negative) of IMDB reviews.
# How it Works
Data is pre-processed (i.e., cleaned, tokenized, lemmatized (group like words), and encoded) and then the CNN model is trained using pre-trained Glove word embedding.
